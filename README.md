# LaTeX Class Files

A few LaTeX class files to make texing easier

## Usage

To use any of the new class files first put them into your tex tree. Run ```kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFHOME``` in your terminal to find your tex home directory. Then clone this repository there or copy the ```tex``` and ```doc``` folder into this directory. Now you should be able to use the class files by typing ```\documentclass{<CLASS>}``` in your tex file. You should also be able to consult the documentation via typing ```texdoc <CLASS>``` in your terminall.
